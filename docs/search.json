This program is needed to collect important data that will help to:\n\nMore accurately assess the fisheries and overall health of fish and invertebrate populations in the USVI. Specifically, this program will enable more accurate estimates of the total amount of fish caught and landed in the Territory (specifically mention stock assessments?).\nTo gather information about boating activities which will allow local agencies to better manage boating facilities (marinas, boat ramps, moorings) and better promote recreational use of resources."
