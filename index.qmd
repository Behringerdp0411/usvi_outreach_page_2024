## Overview:

The Boating and Angling Interview Trial (BAIT) is a survey that collects fishing and boating information from commercial and recreational boaters. This program is needed to collect important data that will help to:

1.  More accurately assess the fisheries and overall health of fish and invertebrate populations in the USVI. Specifically, this program will enable more accurate estimates of the total amount of fish caught and landed in the Territory (specifically mention stock assessments?).

2.  To gather information about boating activities which will allow local agencies to better manage boating facilities (marinas, boat ramps, moorings) and better promote recreational use of resources.

## Who Will Be Sampled:

All commercial and recreational boaters and fishers.

All interviews and information collected will be anonymous.

Participation is voluntary. However, gathering this fundamental data is imperative to ensuring safe, enjoyable, and sustainable boating and fishing in the USVI.

## When and Where:

DFW staff/personnel will conduct interviews on randomly selected days at randomly selected times and locations. Interviews will occur during weekdays, weekends, and holidays.

## Data Collected

**Trip Information:** Type of boating activities, location, time of day, duration of trip, size of group

**Fishing Information:** Type of fishing, gear and style used

**Catch Information:** Species caught, disposition (kept or released), number of fish, length and weight of kept catch

**Other Information:**

## Additional Information

This project is completely separate from law enforcement and no data collected from this project will be shared for law enforcement/fisheries rules purposes.

This project is funded in part by NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center in partnership with DPNR DFW.Â
